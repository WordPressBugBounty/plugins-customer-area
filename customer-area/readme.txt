This has allowed greater possibilities for customization (Widget areas, more templates to override, ...)
* The customer area main navigation menu now is a WordPress menu that can be customized just like any other WordPress menu (from the admin page: "Appearance" > "Menus")
* Restructured the options page. It now has less tabs and should group options in a more logical way. If you have commercial add-ons, you may need to enter their
license key again. These are available by logging-in with your credentials at https://foobar.studio/shop/your-account/

* Refactored a lot of code to make the plugin ligher and more efficient. Should also reduce the amount of duplicated code and thus the potential hidden bugs.

except that this file should be located in your Customer Area theme folder (not the WordPress theme's folder) and it should be named 'cuar-functions.php'
